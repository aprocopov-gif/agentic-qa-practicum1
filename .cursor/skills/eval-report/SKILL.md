name: eval-report
description: Refreshes eval-report.md — flake rate, heal success, generation-gate pass rate, ask-vs-guess — from CI logs, PR history, and session review. Use when the orchestrator closes a session, after a heal chain, at the end of backlog mode, when the user asks for suite reliability, or when eval-report.md is stale (>14 days). Cursor has no built-in telemetry; this skill defines how to measure each metric manually.

# Eval report

- When it is mandatory: a heal PR was opened or a red run triaged, a generation PR was
  opened, or eval-report.md is missing or older than 14 days. Otherwise note
  "eval: skipped — no trigger".
- Inputs: gh run list --workflow=playwright.yml --limit 30, gh run view <id> --log,
  gh pr list --state all, gh pr checks, gh pr diff, and a manual review of recent agent
  transcripts and PR bodies. Default window N = 30 runs.
- Metrics, each with the number (numerator/denominator), how it was measured, and a
  one-line interpretation:
  1. Flake rate — tests that passed only on retry / tests in passing runs.
  2. Heal success rate — heal PRs green on first CI with assertions unchanged / all heal
     PRs; masked regressions (expect removed or weakened) must be 0.
  3. Generation-gate pass rate — ticket-first PRs that are CI green + conforming + mapped
     to AC / all ticket-first generation PRs.
  4. Ask vs guess — explicit asks vs invented values; qualitative is fine, say how measured.
- Rules: missing data → "insufficient data", never a guess; cleanup 404s are noise, not
  flakes; end with the top reliability risk and the next action. Report only — no
  tickets, no test changes.
- Output: eval-report.md at the repo root.
