# [Anna] Playdates: matched slots and manual propose form — AQPBT-9

Feature: Playdates: matched slots and manual propose form: propose a playdate to a circle family

  Signed-in parents with a set-up family (Lev Test / The Gorfels) open Playdates to pick a
  circle family and either a matched availability slot or a manual time and place. The other
  parent must approve before the playdate is confirmed. Send request is not submitted here.

# Happy paths

  Scenario: Playdates shows Find a playdate, Propose, and Send request
    Given I am logged in as Family A with a completed dashboard and at least one circle family
    When I open "/playdates"
    Then I see heading "Find a playdate"

    And I see "Propose"
    And I see "Send request"

  Scenario: Family combobox lists only circle families

  Scenario: Selected circle family shows matches badge and a dated slot
    Given I am logged in as Family A with a completed dashboard

    When matched availability loads
    Then I see "6 matches"
    And I see a matched slot "Sun, Oct 11 10:00am-1:00pm at The Gorfels"

  Scenario: Selecting a matched slot disables the place combobox
    Given I am logged in as Family A with a completed dashboard

  Scenario: Child checkboxes use my children's names and can be changed
    Given I am logged in as Family A with a completed dashboard

    And I can uncheck "Mia" without leaving "/playdates"

  Scenario: Empty Pending requests shows count 0 and empty copy

# Negative

  Scenario: Family B gate hides Propose and Send request
    Given I am logged in as Family B (Anna Procopov) without a set-up dashboard

    Given I am logged in as Family A with a completed dashboard

# Edge cases

<!--
Ambiguities / gaps (Jira out of scope + Confluence open questions):
- What the three unlabeled manual textboxes represent (date / start / end) and whether they sync when a matched slot is selected.
- Badge "6 matches" vs three visible slot buttons — scroll or show more.
- Whether a matched slot can be deselected without reloading.
- Validation and error copy when Send request is pressed with invalid or incomplete input.
- Success feedback after Send request (out of scope for this story).
- Recipient Accept / Decline / cancel when Pending requests count is greater than zero (AQPBT-10).
- Whether Location note is required for either place option.
- Exact dashboard setup required before Playdates unlocks.
